I'm an AI Engineer with a PhD in Structural Biology, currently working at the intersection of machine learning and molecular biology. I specialize in building transformer-based language models for biological sequences (RNA and proteins), with a strong focus on applying modern AI to challenges in drug discovery.

My recent work includes the development of foundational models for biomolecules, with research accepted at ICML and ICLR. I also have experience with graph neural networks and geometric deep learning applied to structural biology problems.

I'm passionate about using data-driven methods to understand and design biological systems. I enjoy contributing to both research and applied projects, and I thrive in interdisciplinary environments where computational tools meet real biological questions.

I'm currently based in Barcelona and open to remote opportunities.
